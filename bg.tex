\startchapter{Background}
In this chapter we will give a rough overview over the challenge that we described in the introduction and how other work tried partially or in full to address these challenges.
Note that we will not go into great detail of the indvidual steps that we undertook in this thesis as we discuss related work in the appropriate chapter.
Thus we will discuss two areas: (1) the research around the concept of socio-technical congruence and (2) recommender systems in sofftware engineering.
