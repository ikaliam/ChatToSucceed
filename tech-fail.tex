\startchapter{Technical Relations and Failure}
\label{chap:tech-net}
With this chapter we survey the rich history in failure predicting to find evidence that technical networks, constructed by project members connected through source code artifatcs, can predict software quality.
We start with detailing our methodology to conduct our literature review (Section~\ref{chap:6:methods}), followed by three sections detailing our findings roughly categorized into: 
(1) work that leverages metrics hinting at technical networks (Section~\ref{chap:6:measure}),
(2) work that is based on software artifact networks (Section~\ref{chap:6:an}),
and (3) work that leverages technical networks (Section~\ref{chap:6:tn}).
And we close this chapter with a discussion of our findings (Section~\ref{chap:6:dis}).
