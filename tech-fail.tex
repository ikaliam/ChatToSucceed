\startchapter{Technical Relations and Failure}
\label{chap:tech-net}
With this chapter we survey the rich history in failure predicting to find evidence that technical networks, constructed by project members connected through source code artifatcs, can predict software quality.
We start with detailing our methodology to conduct our literature review (Section~\ref{chap:6:methods}), followed by three sections detailing our findings roughly categorized into: 
(1) work that leverages metrics hinting at technical networks (Section~\ref{chap:6:measure}),
(2) work that is based on software artifact networks (Section~\ref{chap:6:an}),
and (3) work that leverages technical networks (Section~\ref{chap:6:tn}).
And we close this chapter with a discussion of our findings (Section~\ref{chap:6:dis}).

We conduct a systematic literature review as proposed by ...~\cite{} and proceed in the following seven steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Define research question that the review is supposed to answer.
\item Define search terms.
\item Select relevant venues.
\item Read abstracts of venues that fit search terms.
\item Add paper to repository if adequate.
\item Go through repository and apply search to paper references.
\item Create categories from papers.
\end{enumerate}

The research questions guiding the systematic review is aimed at identifying a connection between technical networks and software quality.

\begin{note}
\emph{RQ:} Can technical network be related to software quality? 
\end{note}

% why do we use a lit review
Due to the history of software engineering research with respect to predicting and finding indicators of software quality, we suspect that enough research has been conducted that shows ample evidence of or against the existence of a relationship between software quality and technical networks.

\end{table}

\paragraph{Search Terms.} Fromn the research question we extracted two sets of search terms.
One set conists of terms related to software quality such as bugs, failure and the other set contains terms that relate to software measures and networks of constructed using software artifacts.
